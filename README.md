# Bracero Theme

An Omeka Classic theme created by modifying the theme Santa Fe. To be used on the Bracero History Archive on versions Omeka Classic 2.8 and above.

Theme settings and simple page text are documented in the `/docs` directory as markdown pages.

The bracero-theme-original zip archive is the original theme from when the site was running Omeka Classic 1.0. These files will not work with current versions of Omeka Classic but are included for informational purposes.
